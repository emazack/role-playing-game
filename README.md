This is a Git repository for a JavaScript-based role-playing game. Explore the code and contribute to the development of this exciting adventure.
## Gameplay
The game is a turn-based battle between the player character and a series of monsters, with the outcome determined by the roll of a virtual dice.
This is a game that involves a player character (a wizard) battling against various monsters. The game mechanics involve using dice to determine damage dealt and taken by both the wizard and the monster. Each monster has its own set of data defined in an external file that is imported into the code.
The attack() function is the main gameplay loop. When the player clicks on the "attack" button, the function is called. You can therefore attack the monster and produce a result. The wizard and monster both roll their dice and deal damage to each other based on the resulting scores. If the wizard's health reaches zero, the game ends with a loss. If the monster's health reaches zero the wizard wins.
